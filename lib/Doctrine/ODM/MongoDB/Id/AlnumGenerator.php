/**
 * AlnumGenerator is responsible for generating cased alpha-numeric unique identifiers.
 * It extends IncrementGenerator in order to ensure uniqueness even with short strings.
 *
 * "Awkward safe mode" avoids combinations that results in 'dirty' words by removing
 * the vouwels from chars index
 *
 * A minimum identifier length can be enforced by setting a numeric value to the "pad" option
 * (with only 6 chars you will have more than 56 billion unique id's, 15 billion in 'awkward safe mode')
