Transactions and Concurrency
============================

Transactions
------------

As per the `documentation <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/write-operations-atomicity/#atomicity-and-transactions>`_, MongoDB
write operations are "atomic on the level of a single document".

Even when updating multiple documents within a single write operation, though the modification of each document is
atomic, the operation as a whole is not and other operations may interleave.

Transaction support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports multi-document transactions on replica sets (starting in MongoDB 4.2) and sharded clusters (MongoDB
4.4). Standalone topologies do not support multi-document transactions.

Transaction Support in Doctrine MongoDB ODM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
    Transaction support in MongoDB ODM was introduced in version 2.7.

You can instruct the ODM to use transactions when writing changes to the databases by enabling the
``useTransactionalFlush`` setting in your configuration:

.. code-block:: php

    $config = new Configuration();
    $config->setUseTransactionalFlush(true);
    // Other configuration

    $dm = DocumentManager::create(null, $config);

From then onwards, any call to ``DocumentManager::flush`` will start a transaction, apply the write operations, then
commit the transaction.

To enable or disable transaction usage for a single flush operation, use the ``withTransaction`` write option when
calling ``DocumentManager::flush``:

.. code-block:: php

    // To explicitly enable transaction for this write
    $dm->flush(['withTransaction' => true]);

    // To disable transaction usage for a write, regardless of the ``useTransactionalFlush`` config:
    $dm->flush(['withTransaction' => false]);

.. note::

    Please note that transactions are only used for write operations executed during the ``flush`` operation. For any
    other operations, e.g. manually executed queries or aggregation pipelines, transactions will not be used and you
    will have to rely on the MongoDB driver's transaction mechanism.

Lifecycle Events and Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using transactional flushes, either through the configuration or explicitly, there are a couple of important things
to note regarding lifecycle events. Due to the way MongoDB transactions work, it is possible that ODM attempts write
operations multiple times. However, to preserve the expectation that lifecycle events are only triggered once per flush
operation, lifecycle events will not be dispatched when the transaction is retried. This maintains current functionality
when a lifecycle event modifies the unit of work, as this change is automatically carried over when the transaction is
retried.

Lifecycle events now expose a ``MongoDB\Driver\Session`` object which needs to be used if it is set. Since MongoDB
transactions are not tied to the connection but only to a session, any command that should be part of the transaction
needs to be told about the session to be used. This does not only apply to write commands, but also to read commands
that need to see the transaction state. If a session is given in a lifecycle event, this session should always be used
regardless of whether a transaction is active or not.


Other Concurrency Controls
--------------------------

Multi-Document transactions provide certain guarantees regarding your database writes and prevent two simultaneous write
operations from interfering with each other. Depending on your use case, this is not enough, as the transactional
guarantee will only apply once you start writing to the database as part of the ``DocumentManager::flush()`` call. This
could still lead to data loss if you replace data that was written to the database by a different process in between you
reading the data and starting the transaction. To solve this problem, optimistic and pessimistic locking strategies can
be used, allowing for fine-grained control over what kind of locking is required for documents in your application.

.. _transactions_and_concurrency_optimistic_locking:

Optimistic Locking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Approach
^^^^^^^^

Doctrine has integrated support for automatic optimistic locking
via a ``version`` field. Any document that should be
protected against concurrent modifications during long-running
business transactions gets a ``version`` field.
When changes to the document are persisted,
the expected version and version increment are incorporated into the update criteria and modifiers, respectively.
If this results in no document being modified by the update (i.e. expected version did not match),
a ``LockException`` is thrown, which indicates that the document was already modified by another query.

.. note::

    | Versioning can only be used on *root* (top-level) documents.

.. note::

    Only types implementing the ``\Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\Types\Versionable`` interface can be used for versioning.
    Following ODM types can be used for versioning: ``int``, ``decimal128``, ``date``, and ``date_immutable``.

Document Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following example designates a version field using the ``int`` type:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: php

        <?php
        /** @Version @Field(type="int") */
        private $version;

    .. code-block:: xml

        <field field-name="version" version="true" type="int" />

Or with ``decimal128`` type:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: php

        <?php
        /** @Version @Field(type="decimal128") */
        private $version;

    .. code-block:: xml

        <field field-name="version" version="true" type="decimal128" />

Alternatively, the ``date`` type may be used:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: php

        <?php
        /** @Version @Field(type="date") */
        private $version;

    .. code-block:: xml

        <field field-name="version" version="true" type="date" />

Or its immutable counterpart ``date_immutable``:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: php

        <?php
        /** @Version @Field(type="date_immutable") */
        private $version;

    .. code-block:: xml

        <field field-name="version" version="true" type="date_immutable" />

Choosing the Field Type
"""""""""""""""""""""""

When using the date-based type in a high-concurrency environment, it is still possible to create multiple documents
with the same version and cause a conflict. This can be avoided by using the ``int`` or ``decimal128`` type.

Usage
"""""

When a version conflict is encountered during
``DocumentManager#flush()``, a ``LockException`` is thrown.
This exception can be caught and handled. Potential responses to a
``LockException`` are to present the conflict to the user or
to refresh or reload objects and then retry the update.

With PHP promoting a share-nothing architecture,
the worst case scenario for a delay between rendering an update form (with existing document data)
and modifying the document after a form submission may be your application's session timeout.
If the document is changed within that time frame by some other request,
it may be preferable to encounter a ``LockException`` when retrieving the document instead of executing the update.

You can specify the expected version of a document during a query with ``DocumentManager#find()``:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    use Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\LockMode;
    use Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\LockException;
    use Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\DocumentManager;

    $theDocumentId = 1;
    $expectedVersion = 184;

    /* @var $dm DocumentManager */

    try {
        $document = $dm->find(User::class, $theDocumentId, LockMode::OPTIMISTIC, $expectedVersion);

        // do the work

        $dm->flush();
    } catch(LockException $e) {
        echo "Sorry, but someone else has already changed this document. Please apply the changes again!";
    }

Alternatively, an expected version may be specified for an existing document with ``DocumentManager#lock()``:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    use Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\LockMode;
    use Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\LockException;
    use Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\DocumentManager;

    $theDocumentId = 1;
    $expectedVersion = 184;

    /* @var $dm DocumentManager */

    $document = $dm->find(User::class, $theDocumentId);

    try {
        // assert version
        $dm->lock($document, LockMode::OPTIMISTIC, $expectedVersion);

    } catch(LockException $e) {
        echo "Sorry, but someone else has already changed this document. Please apply the changes again!";
    }

Important Implementation Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can easily get the optimistic locking workflow wrong if you
compare the wrong versions.

Workflow
""""""""

Say you have Alice and Bob editing a
hypothetical blog post:

-  Alice reads the headline of the blog post being "Foo", at
   optimistic lock version 1 (GET Request)
-  Bob reads the headline of the blog post being "Foo", at
   optimistic lock version 1 (GET Request)
-  Bob updates the headline to "Bar", upgrading the optimistic lock
   version to 2 (POST Request of a Form)
-  Alice updates the headline to "Baz", ... (POST Request of a
   Form)

At the last stage of this scenario the blog post has to be read
again from the database before Alice's headline can be applied. At
this point you will want to check if the blog post is still at
version 1 (which it is not in this scenario).

In order to correctly utilize optimistic locking, you *must* add the version as hidden form field or,
for more security, session attribute.
Otherwise, you cannot verify that the version at the time of update is the same as what was originally read
from the database when Alice performed her original GET request for the blog post.
Without correlating the version across form submissions, the application could lose updates.

Example Code
""""""""""""

The form (GET Request):

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    use Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\DocumentManager;

    /* @var $dm DocumentManager */

    $post = $dm->find(BlogPost::class, 123456);

    echo '<input type="hidden" name="id" value="' . $post->getId() . '" />';
    echo '<input type="hidden" name="version" value="' . $post->getCurrentVersion() . '" />';

And the change headline action (POST Request):

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    use Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\DocumentManager;
    use Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\LockMode;

    /* @var $dm DocumentManager */

    $postId = (int)$_POST['id'];
    $postVersion = (int)$_POST['version'];

    $post = $dm->find(BlogPost::class, $postId, LockMode::OPTIMISTIC, $postVersion);

.. _transactions_and_concurrency_pessimistic_locking:

Pessimistic Locking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doctrine MongoDB ODM also supports pessimistic locking via a configurable ``lock`` field.
This functionality is implemented entirely by Doctrine; MongoDB has no native support for pessimistic locking.

Document Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pessimistic locking requires a document to designate a lock field using the ``int`` type:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: php

        <?php
        /** @Lock @Field(type="int") */
        private $lock;

    .. code-block:: xml

        <field field-name="lock" lock="true" type="int" />

Lock Modes
^^^^^^^^^^

Doctrine MongoDB ODM currently supports two pessimistic lock modes:

-  Pessimistic Write
   (``\Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\LockMode::PESSIMISTIC_WRITE``): locks the
   underlying document for concurrent read and write operations.
-  Pessimistic Read (``\Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\LockMode::PESSIMISTIC_READ``):
   locks other concurrent requests that attempt to update or lock documents
   in write mode.

Usage
^^^^^

You can use pessimistic locks in two different scenarios:

1. Using
   ``DocumentManager#find($className, $id, \Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\LockMode::PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)``
   or
   ``DocumentManager#find($className, $id, \Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\LockMode::PESSIMISTIC_READ)``
2. Using
   ``DocumentManager#lock($document, \Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\LockMode::PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)``
   or
   ``DocumentManager#lock($document, \Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\LockMode::PESSIMISTIC_READ)``

.. warning::

    | A few things could go wrong:
    |
    | If a request fails to complete (e.g. unhandled exception), you may end up with stale locks.
      Said locks would need to be manually released or you would need to devise a strategy to automatically do so.
      One way to mitigate stale locks after an application error would be to gracefully catch the exception
      and ensure that relevant documents are unlocked before the request ends.
    |
    | `Deadlock <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock>`_ situations are also possible.
      Suppose process P1 needs resource R1 and has locked resource R2
      and that another process P2 has locked resource R1 but also needs resource R2.
      If both processes continue waiting for the respective resources, the application will be stuck.
      When loading a document, Doctrine can immediately throw an exception if it is already locked.
      A deadlock could be created by endlessly retrying attempts to acquire the lock.
      One can avoid a possible deadlock by designating a maximum number of retry attempts
      and automatically releasing any active locks with the request ends,
      thereby allowing a process to end gracefully while another completes its task.
